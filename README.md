## Finden  
A small Gnome desktop application to find items on your computer that you are looking for.

**Finden** \[ˈfɪn.dən] is a very simple frontend for the Linux command “find”. It was one of my first programming attempts, incorporating the functionality into an Libadwaita window and also, for the first time, creating a Meson configuration for installation. My App Finden is far from finished and continues to present new challenges for me to expand it. This isn’t about developing a professional app; it’s simply about enjoying the process of building applications.
